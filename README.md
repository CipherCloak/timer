This repository contains a simple yet effective timer application developed in Python using PySide6, a popular framework for building cross-platform graphical user interfaces. The app allows users to set countdown timers with customizable durations, and provides options to trigger alarms (TODO) or notifications when the timer expires. It's a useful tool for productivity, time management, or any scenario where timing is crucial.

**Key Features:**

- Set custom countdown timers.
- Alarm/notification support when the timer ends.
- User-friendly interface built with PySide6.
- Lightweight and fast.
- Dark & Light themes

This project demonstrates the use of PySide6 for building desktop applications in Python, with a focus on clean code, responsiveness, and ease of use.
